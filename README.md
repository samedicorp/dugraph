This tool analyses the Dual Universe recipes.

Most producers output some products that they also use as inputs. For example Metalworks makes Basic Pipes, but also uses them to make Hydraulics.

The tool outputs a list for each producer of:

- the items it makes which require on other items it makes
- the items it makes which don't require on other items it makes

This information can be used to either set up a two-tier production line for each machine, or to work out which items to move back into the input bin with Transfer Units.
